## Class Project
The core of the research on the logistics warehouse operation lies in the use of systematic layout design methods to analyze the relevance of each operation area and make a reasonable overall layout.
Our optimization method is to use Flexsim simulation software to simulate and model the layout plan. By establishing the logic flow between each functional area and setting the physical parameters, the bottleneck problem is optimized and analyzed. The driving force of this research is to obtain the optimal layout plan, to realize the enterprise's requirements for efficient, accurate, and fast transportation of goods into the market, to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise to a certain extent, and to bring higher economic benefits to the enterprise.
